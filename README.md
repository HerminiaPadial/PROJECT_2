- Public, private and/or charter management.
- Educational level

üìÅ **Folder structure**

- [PowerBi](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/es-es/)

Libreries such as:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)
 
 **Acquisition Data**
-----------------------
There are 2 different datasource involved:
- [Datos del Gobierno de Espa√±a](https://datos.gob.es/es)

‚è© **How it works**
-----------------------
There are two displays:

  - The user selects one or more municipalities from a list that includes all the municipalities of Madrid and obtains:
  - Visualization of the municipality on a map.
  - Bar chart showing the number of centers according to their management (public, private, private subsidized).
  - List of the different centers according to the selection and direct access to their website and telephone number.
  - Visualization on a map of the different centers. It is possible to include a starting point. 
  
**- Display B:**
  - The user selects one or several municipalities from a list that includes all the municipalities of Madrid and obtains:
  - Count of the number of centers according to ownership.
  - Graph with: the different municipalities, the number of centers in each of them according to ownership and the average income of each municipality.
